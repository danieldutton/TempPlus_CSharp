Tests assume the following:-

App to be used for earth temperature, not scientific temperatures

Hottest Temperature ever recorded on in earth in Fahrenheit = 136.4F - Death Valley Greenland Ranch, Death Valley, California
Coldest Temperature ever recorded on earth in Fahrenheit = -128.6F - Soviet Vostok Station, Antarctica

Therefore, giving leeway the scale of -150F to 150F is adopted.  
Tests check for accuracy between the following ranges

Testing Scales are therefore

Fahrenheit - minus 150 to plus 150
Celsius -    minus 100 to plus 70
Kelvin -     plus  170 to plus 340
